# Spin_And_Win
It is a project inspired from the shopping websites featuring a giant wheel which spins and rotates. It is away to attract customers as they are lured by giving coupons, discounts or offers and all they have is to just spin the wheel and win exciting prices. My project is similar to it and consist of offers provided by the Coding Blocks to the students.
